<h4>Elevator Pitch:</h4>

<p>It’s 9 o’clock, in the middle of the biggest snowstorm you have ever witnessed. The heating in your dorm has malfunctioned, and you’re bundled in your thickest down jacket, two hats and gloves. BUT! You remember that your COS 333 assignment is due the next night, and (as a typical Princeton student) your schedule is packed for much of the next day. Your hands are bound to freeze if you take off your gloves now… what do you do? Thankfully, your good friends Richard, Ryan, Joseph, and Sam recently introduced their web application, Buggy, to you. With only your voice, you can complete your COS 333 assignment on time and in style, making Professor Kernighan proud!
